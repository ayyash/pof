  <h4 class="f4"><span class='red'>What about October 7?</span></h4><p>So often this question gets asked, and I don‚Äôt blame you for asking it.</p><p>On October 7, a group of Hamas militants set out on a mission to gain at least 30 military captives in order to make a prisoner exchange with over <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.ppsmo.ps/home/studies/11116?culture=ar-SA" target="_blank">6,000 Palestinian prisoners in the occupation jails</a>. Many are children, as young as 12. Many are under &quot;administrative detention.&quot;</p><p>They were faced with a very weak army, and were able to take 250 hostages instead. The IDF activated the <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://electronicintifada.net/content/evidence-israel-killed-its-own-citizens-7-october/41156" target="_blank">Hannibal directive</a> ‚Äî shooting and killing 200 Hamas soldiers, as well as slaughtering several hundred of their own soldiers and civilians.</p><p>Angry, humiliated, and openly stating their <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/4vKuB1su43c" target="_blank">intent for genocide</a>, occupation military leaders decided to indiscriminately bomb the two million Palestinian civilians living in Gaza. Since October 7th, &quot;Israel&quot; has massacred over <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker" target="_blank">22,000 civilians</a> ‚Äî including over 100 journalists, over 400 healthcare workers, and over 11,000 kids. And 80% of the city has been destroyed, 90% of Gazans has been internally displaced, and zero hostages were retrieved. In fact, the IDF killed 3 of their hostages who had escaped and ran forward waving white flags.</p><p>It was never about hostages. It was always about land. And October 7 became occupation&#x27;s perfect excuse to murder without consequence.</p><p><span class='smaller'>üîªPalestine was a land with people, promised by <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/text-of-the-balfour-declaration" target="_blank">Balfour in 1917</a> for the Jewish deportees from Poland, manipulating them to build a Zionist project for the purpose of controlling the Middle East. In 1948 they occupied Palestine, in 202-something Palestine will be free.</span></p>
